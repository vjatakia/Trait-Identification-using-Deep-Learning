# Trait-Identification-using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the Python 3 code for creating models to identify traits like gender and age from audio files using Deep Learning Models like DNN and LSTMs. This problem is a combination of both- Classification and Regression problems. 

The data used is: Stanford Amazing Grace Dataset

Models used: Deep Neural Network(DNN), LSTM

The following is the file description: 
1. dnn_age_modeling.py: This file contains the Python code for creating a DNN Regression model
2. dnn_gender_modeling.py: This file contains the Python code for creating a DNN Classification model
3. lstm_age_modeling.py: This file contains the Python code for creating a LSTM Regression model 
4. lstm_gender_modeling.py: This file contains the Python code for creating a LSTM Classification model
5. SVM_Classification: This file contains the Python code for creating an SVM Classification model used as a baseline for comparisons
6. SVR_Regression: This file contains the Python code for creating an SVM Regression model used as a baseline for comparisons

The report summarizes the procedure and the results obtained.
